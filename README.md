# travel_app

A new Flutter project
My Travel App was designed to help users explore and learn about countries worldwide in an engaging and user-friendly way. Using the REST Countries API, it provides information such as country names, regions, populations, and languages. The app features a Login Screen for secure access, a Home Screen that displays a list of countries and allows users to select one for more details, and a Detail Screen to showcase specific information about the selected country. It ensures smooth navigation and a responsive design. Challenges like parsing API data, handling errors, and creating adaptive layouts were successfully resolved, resulting in an intuitive app that makes discovering global destinations effortless and enjoyable.
